<p align="justify">My research interests lie  broadly in networked systems. I have conducted research on several topics including mobile and wireless networking, content distribution, peer-to-peer systems, Internet architecture,  protocol design and analysis, datacenter systems, and network measurement. Some of my recent  research efforts are:</p>
<div align="justify">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>MobilityFirst</strong>: This "Future
        Internet Architecture" effort seeks to design an implement a
        future Internet with mobility and trustworthiness as central design
        goals. I am  co-leading the MobilityFirst architecture in
        collaboration with Rutgers and several other institutions.  Check out
        the <a href="http://mobilityfirst.cs.umass.edu/">project
        page</a> for an overview.

    <li>
        <strong>Robust wireless  stack</strong>: Seeks to develop a robust protcol stack for diverse wireless networks ranging from well-connected mesh networks to to highly mobile, vehicular, or disruption-tolerant networks. 
        <ul>
            <li>Routing: <a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/R3.pdf">R3 </a>(MobiCom'11) ensures robust routing performance in any kind of a multi-hop wireless network. R3 builds upon  our work on RAPID (IEEE/ACM ToN'10, Sigcomm'07), one of the first DTN routing protocols validated by real deployment.</li>
            <li>Transport: <a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/hop.pdf">Hop</a> (NSDI'09) is a "block-switched" hop-by-hop transport protocol that dramatically outperforms TCP  and is robust to routing disruptions.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Mobile P3</strong>: Seeks to optimize performance, price, and power consumption in a multi-technology mobile world. Check out our work on <a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/TailEnder.pdf">TailEnder</a><a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/tailender.pdf"></a> (IMC'09) to optimize 3G power consumption, and <a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/wiffler.pdf">Wiffler</a> (MobiSys'10) to balance performance and 3G usage.</li>
    <li><strong>Content networking</strong>: Our recent <a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/diverseTE.pdf">paper</a> (Infocom'11) reveals  surprising implications of replicated content on ISP traffic engineering. </li>
