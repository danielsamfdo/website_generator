The recent IC scheduling theory focuses on these sources of unpredictability by crafting schedules that maximize the number of executable jobs at every point in time. In this paper, we experimentally investigate the key question: does IC scheduling yield significant positive benefits for real IC? To this end, we develop a realistic computation model to match jobs to client machines and conduct extensive simulations to compare IC-optimal schedules against popular, intuitively compelling heuristics. Our results suggest that for a large range of computation-dags, client availability patterns, and two quite different performance metrics, IC-optimal schedules significantly outperform schedules produced by popular heuristics, by as much as 10-20%.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@proceedings{IC,<br> author = {Rob Hall and Arnold Rosenberg and Arun Venkataramani},<br> booktitle = {IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS)},<br>  link = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4227973/},<br> month = {March},<br> title = {A Comparison of DAG Scheduling Strategies for Internet-Based Computing},<br> year = {2007}<br>}<br><br></div></div></li><br/><li><a href='http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/BT_availability.pdf'>Availability in BitTorrent Systems</a><br/> Giovanni Neglia and Giuseppe Reina and Honggang Zhang and Donald Towsley and Arun Venkataramani and John Danaher, <br/>IEEE INFOCOM, May 2007 <br/><div class='abstract_show_hide'>[+]Show Abstract</div><div class='ab_entry'><div class='abstractentry'>In this paper, we investigate the problem of highly available, massive-scale file distribution in the Internet.

The first generation of BitTorrent systems used a central tracker to enable coordination among peers, resulting in low availability due to the tracker's single point of failure. Our study analyzes the prevalence and impact of two recent trends to improve BitTorrent availability: (i) use of multiple trackers, and (ii) use of Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs), both of which also help to balance load better. The study considered more than 1,400 trackers and 24,000 DHT nodes (extracted from about 20,000 torrents) over a period of two months. We find that both trends improve availability, but for different and somewhat unexpected reasons. Our findings include: (i) multiple trackers improve availability, but the improvement largely comes from the choice of a single highly available tracker, (ii) such improvement is reduced by the presence of correlated failures, (iii) multiple trackers can significantly reduce the connectivity of the overlay formed by peers, (iv) the DHT improves information availability, but induces a higher response latency to peer queries.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{BTavailability,<br> author = {Giovanni Neglia and Giuseppe Reina and Honggang Zhang and Donald Towsley and Arun Venkataramani and John Danaher},<br> booktitle = {IEEE INFOCOM},<br>  link = {http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/BT_availability.pdf},<br> month = {May},<br> title = {Availability in BitTorrent Systems},<br> year = {2007}<br>}<br><br></div></div></li><br/><li><a href='http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/harp.pdf'>A Multipath Background Network Architecture</a><br/> Ravi Kokku and Aniruddha Bohra and Samrat Ganguly and Arun Venkataramani, <br/>IEEE INFOCOM, May 2007,<br/>Extended <a href=http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/harp_extended.pdf> techreport </a> with full proofs <br/><div class='abstract_show_hide'>[+]Show Abstract</div><div class='ab_entry'><div class='abstractentry'>Background transfers, or transfers that humans do not actively wait on, dominate the Internet today.

The primary focus of these mechanisms is to increase the likelihood of finding a path with limited information, and so these approaches have only an incidental effect on such routing metrics as maximum or average delivery delay. In this paper, we present RAPID, an intentional DTN routing protocol that can optimize a specific routing metric such as the worst-case delivery delay or the fraction of packets that are delivered within a deadline. The key insight is to treat DTN routing as a resource allocation problem that translates the routing metric into per-packet utilities that determine how packets should be replicated in the system. We evaluate RAPID rigorously through a prototype deployed over a vehicular DTN testbed of 40 buses and simulations based on real traces. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to report on a routing protocol deployed on a real outdoor DTN. Our results suggest that RAPID significantly outperforms existing routing protocols for several metrics.

Our application-centric, empirical approach yields two rather unexpected findings. First, link utilization metrics, and MLU in particular, are poor predictors of application performance. Despite significant differences in MLU, all TE schemes and even a static shortest-path routing scheme achieve nearly identical application performance. Second, application adaptation in the form of location diversity, i.e., the ability to download content from multiple potential locations, significantly improves the capacity achieved by all schemes. Even the ability to download from just 2–4 locations enables all TE schemes to achieve near-optimal capacity, and even static routing to be within 30 % of optimal.

A multi-homed stationary user or a stationary user shifting among multiple devices attached to different networks will persistently keep his/her identity but will change access networks and the IP address to which his/her identity is associated. We perform a measurement study of such user transitioning among networks from a network-level point of view, characterizing the sequence of networks to which a user is attached and discuss insights and implications drawn from these measurements. We characterize network transitioning in terms of network residency time, degree of multi-homing, transition rates and more. We find that users typically spend time attached to a small number of access networks, and that a surprisingly large number of users access two networks contemporaneously.

The strategy is incentive-compatible since any CDN that deviates from the strategy ends up with a lower utility. The strategy is also efficient since it produces a total utility that is at least two thirds of the social optimal utility.

Does such a constant-competitive deterministic algorithm (with a constant-factor blowup in the machine capacities) exist for the hierarchical cooperative caching problem? The main contribution of the present paper is to answer this question in the negative. More specifi- cally, we establish an Ω(log log n) lower bound on the competitive ratio of any online hierarchical cooperative caching algorithm with capacity blowup O((log n)^1−ε), where ε denotes an arbitrarily small positive constant.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{ohcc-spaa,<br> author = {Xiaozhou Li and C.

In this paper, we present RAPID, an intentional DTN routing protocol that can optimize a specific routing metric such as worst-case delivery latency or the fraction of packets that are delivered within a deadline. The key insight is to treat DTN routing as a resource allocation problem that translates the routing metric into per-packet utilities which determine how packets should be replicated in the system. We evaluate RAPID rigorously through a prototype of RAPID deployed over a vehicular DTN testbed of 40 buses and simulations based on real traces. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to report on a routing protocol deployed on a real DTN at this scale. Our results suggest that RAPID significantly outperforms existing routing protocols for several metrics.

However, the ubiquity and low cost of WiFi suggests an attractive alternative, namely, opportunistic use of open WiFi access points (APs) or planned municipal mesh networks. Unfortunately, for vehicular users, the intermittent nature of WiFi connectivity makes it challenging to support popular interactive applications such as Web search and browsing. Our work is driven by two questions. 1) How can we enable system support for interactive web applications to tolerate disruptions in WiFi connectivity from mobile nodes? 2) Can opportunistic mobile-to-mobile (m2m) transfers enhance application performance over only using APs, and if so, under what conditions and by how much? We present Thedu, a system that enables access to Web search from moving vehicles. The key idea is to use aggressive prefetching to transform the interactive Web search application into a one-shot request/response process. We deployed a prototype of Thedu on the DieselNet testbed in Amherst, MA, consisting of transit buses averaging 21 on the road at a time. Our deployment results show that Thedu can deliver 4 times as many relevant web pages than not using Thedu. A bus receives relevant web pages with a mean delay of 2.3 minutes and within 0.55 minutes in areas with high AP density. Thedu augments AP connectivity with m2m transfers using a utility-driven DTN routing algorithm and uses caching to exploit query locality. Our analytic model and trace-driven simulations suggest that m2m routing yields little benefit over using APs alone even under moderately dense AP deployment such as in Amherst. With sparsely deployed APs as may be the case in rural areas, our conclusions are more mixed: m2m routing with caching improves the number of relevant responses delivered per bus by up to 58%, but the mean delay is significantly high at 6.7 minutes, calling into question its practicality for interactive applications.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{thedu-mobicom,<br> author = {Aruna Balasubramanian and Brian N.

Using this model, we develop TailEnder, a protocol that reduces energy consumption of common mobile applications. For applications that can tolerate a small delay such as e-mail, TailEnder schedules transfers so as to minimize the cumulative energy consumed meeting user-specified deadlines. We show that the TailEnder scheduling algorithm is within a factor 2x of the optimal and show that any online algorithm can at best be within a factor 1.62x of the optimal.

The emergence of such "network-CDNs" (NCDNs) is driven both by market forces as well as the cost of carrying ever-increasing volumes of traffic across their backbones. An NCDN has the flexibility to determine both where content is placed and how traffic is routed within the network. However NCDNs today continue to treat traffic engineering independently from content placement and request redirection decisions. In this paper, we investigate the interplay between content distribution strategies and traffic engineering and ask whether or how an NCDN should address these concerns in a joint manner. Our experimental analysis, based on traces from a large content distribution network and real ISP topologies, shows that realistic (i.e., history-based) joint optimization strategies offer little benefit (and often significantly underperform) compared to simple and "unplanned" strategies for routing and placement such as InverseCap and LRU. We also find that the simpler strategies suffice to achieve network cost and user-perceived latencies close to those of a joint-optimal strategy with future knowledge.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{DBLP:conf/sigmetrics/SharmaVS13,<br> author = {Abhigyan Sharma and Arun Venkataramani and Ramesh K.

Most prior efforts have focused on attacks that can be addressed using traditional cryptographic techniques to ensure authentication or integrity, e.g., BGPSec and related works. Although augmenting BGP with authentication and integrity mechanisms is critical, they are, by design, far from sufficient to prevent attacks based on manipulating the complex BGP protocol itself. In this paper, we identify two serious attacks on two of the most fundamental goals of BGP-to ensure reachability and to enable ASes to pick routes available to them according to their routing policies-even in the presence of BGPSec-like mechanisms. Our key contributions are to (1) formalize a series of critical security properties, (2) experimentally validate using commodity router implementations that BGP fails to achieve those properties, (3) quantify the extent of these vulnerabilities in the Internet's AS topology, and (4) propose simple modifications to provably ensure that those properties are satisfied. Our experiments show that, using our attacks, a single malicious AS can cause thousands of other ASes to become disconnected from thousands of other ASes for arbitrarily long, while our suggested modifications almost completely eliminate such attacks.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@article{DBLP:journals/ton/SongVG16,<br> author = {Yang Song and Arun Venkataramani and Lixin Gao},<br> bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, http://dblp.org},<br> biburl = {http://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/bib/journals/ton/SongVG16},<br>  doi = {10.1109/TNET.2015.2503642},<br> journal = {{IEEE/ACM} Trans.

A multi-homed stationary user or a stationary user shifting among multiple devices attached to different networks will persistently keep his/her identity but will change access networks and the IP address to which his/her identity is associated. We perform a measurement study of such user transitioning among networks from a network-level point of view, characterizing the sequence of networks to which a user is attached and discuss insights and implications drawn from these measurements. We characterize network transitioning in terms of network residency time, degree of multi-homing, transition rates and more. We find that users typically spend time attached to a small number of access networks, and that a surprisingly large number of users access two networks contemporaneously.

MobilityFirst enhances mobility by cleanly separating names or identifiers from addresses or network locations, and enhances security by representing both in an intrinsically verifiable manner, relying upon a massively scalable, distributed, global name service to bind names and addresses, and to facilitate services including device-to-service, multicast, anycast, and context-aware communication, content retrieval, and more.

As part of this effort, we introduce a new model-based control approach that relies on an accurate yet concise “cheat sheet” based on a priori offline measurement to predict swarm performance as a function of the server bandwidth and other swarm parameters. Our evaluation using a prototype system, SwarmServer, instantiating static, dynamic, and model-based controllers shows that static and dynamic controllers can both be suboptimal due to different reasons. In comparison, a model-based approach consistently outperforms both static and dynamic approaches provided it has access to detailed measurements in the regime of interest.

In this paper we consider distributed clouds that host virtual desktops(VDs) which are then accessed by their users through remote desktop protocols. VDs have different sensitivities to latency, primarily determined by the types of applications running (games or video players are more sensitive to latency) and the end users' locations. We design VMShadow, a system to automatically optimize the location and performance of latency-sensitive VDs in the cloud. VMShadow performs black-box fingerprinting of a VM's network traffic to infer its latency-sensitivity and employs a greedy heuristic based algorithm to move highly latency-sensitive VMs to cloud sites that are closer to their end users. VMShadow employs WAN-based live migration and a new network connection migration protocol to ensure that the VM migration and subsequent changes to the VM's network address are transparent to end-users. We implement a prototype of VMShadow in a nested hypervisor and demonstrate its effectiveness for optimizing the performance of VM-based desktops in the cloud. Our experiments on a private and the public EC2 cloud show that VMShadow is able to discriminate between latency-sensitive and insensitive desktop applications and judiciously move only those VMs that will benefit the most. For desktop VMs with video activity, VMShadow improves VNC's refresh rate by 90%. Further our connection migration proxy, which utilizes dynamic rewriting of packet headers, imposes a rewriting overhead of only 13μs per packet.

We use the model to analyze the availability and the performance implications of bundling, a strategy commonly adopted by many BitTorrent publishers today. We find that even a limited amount of bundling exponentially reduces content unavailability. For swarms with highly unavailable publishers, the availability gain of bundling can result in a net decrease in average download time.

A number of these shortcomings can be traced back to naming. The current Internet uses IP addresses to conflate identity and network location, which results in poor support for mobility and multihoming; vulnerability to hijacking and spoofing of addresses, etc. The Internet's name resolution infrastructure deeply embeds in its design the assumption of mostly stationary hosts and poorly satisfies the performance, security, and functionality demanded by modern mobile services. As a step towards addressing these shortcomings, we present the design of a global name service that forms a central component of the MobilityFirst, a clean-slate Internet architecture with mobility and trustworthiness as principal design goals. MobilityFirst relies on the global name service to cleanly separate identity from network location and to resolve identifiers to locations in a secure manner. More importantly, MobilityFirst capitalizes on the role of the name resolution infrastructure as a logically central, first point of contact to significantly enhance a number of network-layer functions such as supporting host and network mobility, multi-homed traffic engineering, content retrieval, multicast, and next-generation context-aware services. This paper identifies key challenges that must be addressed to realize such a vision and outlines the design of a distributed global name service that can resolve identifiers to dynamic attributes in a fast, consistent, and cost-effective manner at Internet scales.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{DBLP:conf/comsnets/VenkataramaniSTUWKR13,<br> author = {Arun Venkataramani and Abhigyan Sharma and Xiaozheng Tie and Hardeep Uppal and David Westbrook and Jim Kurose and Dipankar Raychaudhuri},<br> bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, http://dblp.org},<br> biburl = {http://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/bib/conf/comsnets/<br>VenkataramaniSTUWKR13},<br> booktitle = {Fifth International Conference on Communication Systems and<br>Networks, {COMSNETS} 2013, Bangalore, India, January 7-10, 2013},<br>  crossref = {DBLP:conf/comsnets/2013},<br> doi = {10.1109/COMSNETS.2013.6465579},<br> link = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/COMSNETS.2013.6465579},<br> pages = {1--9},<br> timestamp = {Mon, 25 Feb 2013 15:54:43 +0100},<br> title = {Design requirements of a global name service for a mobility- centric, trustworthy internetwork},<br> year = {2013}<br>}<br><br></div></div></li><br/><li><a href='http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2013.32'>Identifying and Addressing Protocol Manipulation Attacks in "Secure" BGP</a><br/> Yang Song and Arun Venkataramani and Lixin Gao, <br/>IEEE 33rd International Conference on Distributed Computing

These prior efforts have largely focused on attacks that can be addressed using traditional cryptographic mechanisms to ensure authentication or integrity (e.g., S-BGP). Although augmenting BGP with authentication and integrity mechanisms is critical, it is far from sufficient to prevent attacks based on manipulating the complex BGP protocol itself. In this paper, we identify two serious protocol manipulation attacks that undermine the two most fundamental goals of the BGP control plane -- to ensure reachability and enable ASes to pick routes according to their routing policies -- despite the presence of S-BGP-like mechanisms. Our key contributions are to (1) formalize two critical security properties, (2) experimentally validate using commodity router implementations that BGP fails to achieve them, (3) quantify the extent of the resulting vulnerabilities in the Internet's AS topology, and (4) design and implement simple modifications to provably ensure that those properties are satisfied. Our experiments show that, a single malicious AS can cause thousands of other ASes to become disconnected from thousands of other ASes for arbitrarily long, while our proposed modifications almost completely eliminates such attacks.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{DBLP:conf/icdcs/SongVG13,<br> author = {Yang Song and Arun Venkataramani and Lixin Gao},<br> bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, http://dblp.org},<br> biburl = {http://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/bib/conf/icdcs/SongVG13},<br> booktitle = {{IEEE} 33rd International Conference on Distributed Computing<br>Systems, {ICDCS} 2013, 8-11 July, 2013, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {USA}},<br>  crossref = {DBLP:conf/icdcs/2013},<br> doi = {10.1109/ICDCS.2013.32},<br> link = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2013.32},<br> pages = {550--559},<br> timestamp = {Thu, 11 Dec 2014 17:34:06 +0100},<br> title = {Identifying and Addressing Protocol Manipulation Attacks in "Secure" BGP},<br> year = {2013}<br>}<br><br></div></div></li><br/><li><a href='http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2013.6562871'>On the CDN pricing game</a><br/> Yang Song and Arun Venkataramani and Lixin Gao, <br/>2013 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM Workshops, Turin, Italy, April

The strategy is incentive-compatible since any CDN that deviates from the strategy ends up with a lower utility. The strategy is also efficient since it produces a total utility that is at least two thirds of the social optimal utility.

Example of specific advanced services supported by the protocol stack, including multi-homing, mobility with disconnection, and content retrieval/caching are given for illustration.

To bridge this disparity, BlockRate employs multiple bitrates within a block that are predictive of future channel conditions. In each feedback round, BlockRate uses a historybased scheme to predict the SNR for packets within the next block. In slow-changing scenarios as under pedestrian mobility, BlockRate uses a simple linear regression model to predict the SNR trend over the next block.

The key insight in ZZ is to use f+1 execution replicas in the normal case and to activate additional replicas only upon failures. In data centers where multiple applications share a physical server, ZZ reduces the aggregate number of execution replicas running in the data center, improving throughput and response times. ZZ relies on virtualization---a technology already employed in modern data centers---for fast replica activation upon failures, and enables newly activated replicas to immediately begin processing requests by fetching state on-demand. A prototype implementation of ZZ using the BASE library and Xen shows that, when compared to a system with 2f+1 replicas, our approach yields lower response times and up to 33% higher throughput in a prototype data center with four BFT web applications.

Despite significant differences in MLU, all TE schemes and even a static shortest-path routing scheme achieve nearly identical application performance. Second, application adaptation in the form of location diversity, i.e., the ability to download content from multiple potential locations, significantly improves the capacity achieved by all schemes. Even the ability to download from just 2–4 locations enables all TE schemes to achieve near-optimal capacity, and even static routing to be within 30 % of optimal.

To this end, we perform a pricing analysis to estimate the cost of running a public cloud based DR service and show significant cost reductions compared to using privately owned resources.

In this paper, we present RAPID, an intentional DTN routing protocol that can optimize a specific routing metric such as the worst-case delivery delay or the fraction of packets that are delivered within a deadline. The key insight is to treat DTN routing as a resource allocation problem that translates the routing metric into per-packet utilities that determine how packets should be replicated in the system.

However, there is a limit to how much cost savings can be gained from swarming; for example, for unpopular content peers will always depend on the publisher in order to complete their downloads. In this paper, we investigate this dependence. For this purpose, we propose a new metric, namely swarm self-sustainability. A swarm is referred to as self-sustaining if all its blocks are collectively held by peers; the self-sustainability of a swarm is the fraction of time in which the swarm is self-sustaining. We pose the following question: how does the self-sustainability of a swarm vary as a function of content popularity, the service capacity of the users, and the size of the file? We present a model to answer the posed question. We then propose efficient solution methods to compute self-sustainability. The accuracy of our estimates is validated against simulation.

We then design a system, called Wiffler, to augments mobile 3G capacity. It uses two key ideas leveraging delay tolerance and fast switching -- to overcome the poor availability and performance of WiFi. For delay tolerant applications, Wiffler uses a simple model of the environment to predict WiFi connectivity. It uses these predictions to delays transfers to offload more data on WiFi, but only if delaying reduces 3G usage and the transfers can be completed within the application's tolerance threshold. For applications that are extremely sensitive to delay or loss (e.g., VoIP), Wiffler quickly switches to 3G if WiFi is unable to successfully transmit the packet within a small time window. We implement and deploy Wiffler in our vehicular testbed. Our experiments show that Wiffler significantly reduces 3G usage.

Using this model, we develop TailEnder, a protocol that reduces energy consumption of common mobile applications. For applications that can tolerate a small delay such as e-mail, TailEnder schedules transfers so as to minimize the cumulative energy consumed meeting user-specified deadlines.

Our deployment results show that Thedu can deliver 4 times as many relevant web pages than not using Thedu. A bus receives relevant web pages with a mean delay of 2.3 minutes and within 0.55 minutes in areas with high AP density. Thedu augments AP connectivity with m2m transfers using a utility-driven DTN routing algorithm and uses caching to exploit query locality. Our analytic model and trace-driven simulations suggest that m2m routing yields little benefit over using APs alone even under moderately dense AP deployment such as in Amherst. With sparsely deployed APs as may be the case in rural areas, our conclusions are more mixed: m2m routing with caching improves the number of relevant responses delivered per bus by up to 58%, but the mean delay is significantly high at 6.7 minutes, calling into question its practicality for interactive applications.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{thedu-mobicom,<br> author = {Aruna Balasubramanian and Brian N.

We find that current WiFi handoff methods, in which clients communicate with one basestation at a time, lead to frequent disruptions in connectivity. We also find that clients can overcome many disruptions by communicating with multiple basestations simultaneously. These findings lead us to develop ViFi, a protocol that opportunistically exploits basestation diversity to minimize disruptions and support interactive applications for mobile clients. ViFi uses a decentralized and lightweight probabilistic algorithm for coordination between participating basestations. Our evaluation using a twomonth long deployment and trace-driven simulations shows that its link-layer performance comes close to an ideal diversity-based protocol. Using two applications, VoIP and short TCP transfers, we show that the link layer performance improvement translates to better application performance.

A router applies a received update immediately to its forwarding table before propagating the update to other routers, including those that potentially depend upon the outcome of the update. Responsiveness comes at the cost of routing loops and blackholes-a router A thinks its route to a destination is via B but B disagrees. By favoring responsiveness (a liveness property) over consistency (a safety property), Internet routing has lost both. Our position is that consistent state in a distributed system makes its behavior more predictable and securable. To this end, we present consensus routing, a consistency-first approach that cleanly separates safety and liveness using two logically distinct modes of packet delivery: a stable mode where a route is adopted only after all dependent routers have agreed upon it, and a transient mode that heuristically forwards the small fraction of packets that encounter failed links. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that consensus routing improves overall availability when used in conjunction with existing transient mode heuristics such as backup paths, deflections, or detouring. Experiments on the Internet's AS-level topology show that consensus routing eliminates nearly all transient disconnectivity in BGP.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{consensus,<br> author = {John P.

Our utility-driven architecture addresses three key challenges for such rich multi-user sensor networks: how to define utility functions for networks with data sharing among end-users, how to compress and prioritize data transmissions according to its importance to end-users, and how to gracefully degrade end-user utility in the presence of bandwidth fluctuations. We instantiate this architecture in the context of geographically distributed wireless radar sensor networks for weather, and present results from an implementation of our system on a multi-hop wireless mesh network that uses real radar data with real end-user applications.

In this paper, we present RAPID, an intentional DTN routing protocol that can optimize a specific routing metric such as worst-case delivery latency or the fraction of packets that are delivered within a deadline. The key insight is to treat DTN routing as a resource allocation problem that translates the routing metric into per-packet utilities which determine how packets should be replicated in the system. We evaluate RAPID rigorously through a prototype of RAPID deployed over a vehicular DTN testbed of 40 buses and simulations based on real traces. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to report on a routing protocol deployed on a real DTN at this scale.

However, applications might desire path properties between arbitary end-hosts. Hence, iPlane exports a query interface through which applications can request predictions of path properties between arbitrary end-hosts. • Applications can choose to upload to iPlane a few (typically 10) traceroutes outgoing from their clients. The traceroutes from a client help iPlane capture the routing diversity near that client for better predicting the performance of paths from it. While this information improves prediction accuracy, iPlane can also operate without having this information. iPlane maintains a database-like view of path properties between pairs of end-hosts. For every source-destination pair, there exists a row in the view with iPlane’s predicted path between these hosts and the predicted performance of the path. Any query to iPlane involves an SQL-like query on this view – selecting some rows and columns, joining the view with itself, sorting rows based on values in certain columns, and so on. We provide tools that applications can use for interacting with iPlane. We also make the source code for all our tools publicly available.

While these models are simple, they can often fail systematically; for example, the most widely used models use metric embeddings that predict no benefit to detour routes even though half of all Internet routes can benefit from detours.In this paper, we adopt a structural approach that predicts path latency based on measurements of the Internet's routing topology, PoP connectivity, and routing policy. We find that our approach outperforms Vivaldi, the most widely used black-box model. Furthermore, unlike metric embeddings, our approach successfully predicts 65% of detour routes in the Internet. The number of measurements used in our approach is comparable with that required by black box techniques, but using traceroutes instead of pings.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{explanatory,<br> author = {Harsha Madhyastha and Thomas E.

PRACTI systems can replicate or cache any subset of data on any node (Partial Replication), provide a broad range of consistency guarantees (Arbitrary Consistency), and permit any node to send information to any other node (Topology Independence). A PRACTI architecture yields two significant advantages. First, by providing all three PRACTI properties, it enables better trade-offs than existing mechanisms that support at most two of the three desirable properties. The PRACTI approach thus exposes new points in the design space for replication systems. Second, the flexibility of PRACTI protocols simplifies the design of replication systems by allowing a single architecture to subsume a broad range of existing systems and to reduce development costs for new ones. To illustrate both advantages, we use our PRACTI prototype to emulate existing server replication, client-server, and object replication systems and to implement novel policies that improve performance for mobile users, web edge servers, and grid computing by as much as an order of magnitude.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{belaramani06practi,<br> author = {Nalini Belaramani and Mike Dahlin and Lei Gao and Amol Nayate and Arun Venkataramani and Praveen Yalagandula and Jiandan Zheng},<br> booktitle = {USENIX NSDI},<br>  link = {http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/PRACTI.pdf},<br> month = {March},<br> title = {PRACTI Replication},<br> year = {2006}<br>}<br><br></div></div></li><br/><li><a href='http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/oasis.pdf'>Oasis: An Overlay-Aware Network Stack</a><br/> Harsha Madhyastha and Thomas E.

Though replication has several benefits for large-scale systems distributed across wide-area networks, it also introduces considerable complexity over a centralized unreplicated system. This thesis contributes mechanisms and algorithms that enable the design of simpler and more efficient large-scale replicated systems. On the mechanism front, we present aggressive speculative replication (ASR) as a basic primitive in building large-scale replicated systems. ASR refers to aggressively trading-off costs of hardware resources for making replicas of content and updates in a speculative manner in return for savings in human time and improved service quality. Today, replicated systems are unable to avail of the benefits of ASR as current architectures rely on manually-tuned parameters to manage the complexity of large-scale replicated systems. Consequently, such systems are hard to build and maintain, inefficient in utilizing available resources, and prone to the risk of overload. As a solution, we present an architecture, Mars, that performs ASR in a self-tuning manner, i.e. without the need for manual tuning. To enable realization of Mars' architecture in practical systems, we build TCP Nice, an end-to-end transport protocol for background transfers. We demonstrate the benefits of Mars through a case study of a Web prefetching system, NPS, and show that the Mars approach simplifies the design, efficiently uses available resources to give performance benefits, is robust to the risk of system overload, and is easily deployable without changing existing infrastructure by using only simple end-to-end mechanisms. On the algorithmic front, we make three contributions. First, we present a speculative replication algorithm, namely, long-term prefetching, to minimize average response times at a large cache constrained by bandwidth and validate its effectiveness through simulations using Web traces. Next, we develop a speculative replication algorithm for minimizing response times in a set of hierarchically-organized distributed cooperating caches constrained by bandwidth, and show that it is constant-competitive. Finally, we study the theoretically intriguing problem of minimizing average response times in a set of hierarchically-organized distributed cooperating caches constrained by storage space and show a nonconstant lower bound on the competitive ratio of any online algorithm that is allowed at most a constant-factor space advantage.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@phdthesis{phd-thesis,<br> author = {Arun Venkataramani},<br>  institution = {Computer Sciences, University of Texas at Austin},<br> link = {http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/arun_phdthesis.pdf},<br> month = {December},<br> title = {Mechanisms and Algorithms for Large-Scale Replication Systems},<br> year = {2004}<br>}<br><br></div></div></li><br/><li><a href='http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/ohcc-spaa.pdf'>Online Hierarchical Cooperative Caching</a><br/> Xiaozhou Li and C.

First, it reduces replication costs because the new architecture can tolerate faults in up to half of the state machine replicas that execute requests. Previous systems can tolerate faults in at most a third of the combined agreement/state machine replicas. Second, separating agreement from execution allows a general privacy firewall architecture to protect confidentiality through replication. In contrast, replication in previous systems hurts confidentiality because exploiting the weakest replica can be sufficient to compromise the system. We have constructed a prototype and evaluated it running both microbenchmarks and an NFS server.

However, given the rapid fluctuations of available network bandwidth and changing resource costs due to technology trends, hand tuning the aggressiveness of background transfers risks (1) complicating applications, (2) being too aggressive and interfering with other applications, and (3) being too timid and not gaining the benefits of background transfers. Our goal is for the operating system to manage network resources in order to provide a simple abstraction of near zero-cost background transfers. Our system, TCP Nice, can provably bound the interference inflicted by background flows on foreground flows in a restricted network model. And our microbenchmarks and case study applications suggest that in practice it interferes little with foreground flows, reaps a large fraction of spare network bandwidth, and simplifies application construction and deployment. For example, in our prefetching case study application, aggressive prefetching improves demand performance by a factor of three when Nice manages resources; but the same prefetching hurts demand performance by a factor of six under standard network congestion control.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{tcp-nice-osdi,<br> author = {Arun Venkataramani and Ravi Kokku and Mike Dahlin},<br> booktitle = {USENIX OSDI},<br>  link = {http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/tcp-nice-osdi.pdf},<br> month = {December},<br> title = {TCP Nice: A Mechanism for Background Transfers},<br> year = {2002}<br>}<br><br></div></div></li><br/><li><a href='http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/massive-replication.pdf'>Operating System Support for Massive Replication</a><br/> Arun Venkataramani and Ravi Kokku and Mike Dahlin, <br/>Proceedings of the ACM SIGOPS European Workshop, Saint-Emilion, France, September 2002 <br/><div class='abstract_show_hide'>[+]Show Abstract</div><div class='ab_entry'><div class='abstractentry'>This paper first argues that operating systems should provide support for massive replication of data and services.

The key strength of CheatSheet is its use of the measurement-based model that enables it to converge to the optimal allocation in a single round. We evaluate an im-plemented prototype of CheatSheet and show that it signif-icantly improves swarm performance and server bandwidth cost compared to BitTorrent as well as state-of-the-art ap-proaches to control capacity allocation in an online manner. For the max-min metric for download rate among swarms, CheatSheet performs better than the online strategy by 10% and a naive controller strategy by 20%. It also enables band-width savings compared to online controller strategy by as much as 50% in some cases.</div></div></li><br/><li><a href='http://www.lbd.dcc.ufmg.br/bdbcomp/servlet/Trabalho?id=9024'>On P2P systems for enterprise content delivery</a> <br>A De A Antonio and Daniel S Menasché and Don Towsley and Arun Venkataramani  <br/><div class='abstract_show_hide'>[+]Show Abstract</div><div class='ab_entry'><div class='abstractentry'>In this paper we address the problem of optimizing p2p systems for enterprise bandwidth cost savings. Consider a scenario where an enterprise uses p2p swarming to deliver content to its clients. A content may be a file or a package (bundle) of files. For popular and large content, our work finds that enterprise servers can exclusively rely on the cooperation among the peers in the form of a swarm to disseminate the files. We introduce the idea of self sus-taining swarms, i.e., swarms where the presence of the server is not necessary for the content to be efficiently transmitted. We characterize, under different scenarios, the concept of self sustainability. We then focus on swarms that are not always self sustaining, and propose a scheme for the server to decide how much bandwidth to allocate to a swarm as a function of the arrival and depar-ture rate of the peers. To show the applicability of our controller, we deploy BitTorrent clients in PlanetLab and in a local cluster. Our emulations confirm that the controller leads to significant improvements in terms of cost savings without degrading the download time for the clients. Finally, we analyze the case of an enterprise providing content through multiple swarms, and present an optimization framework that can be used to determine how much bandwidth should be allocated for each of the swarms.</div></div></li><br/><li><a href='http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/SSN.pdf'>Social Security for the Internet</a> <br>Thomas E Anderson and Arun Venkataramani  <br/><div class='abstract_show_hide'>[+]Show Abstract</div><div class='ab_entry'><div class='abstractentry'>Recent times have seen several intriguing proposals to combat denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, where malicious users flood a limited resource preventing legitimate users from accessing that resource. All of these proposals reconcile themselves to the following common fate: if B bad users attack a limited resource being accessed by G good users, then good users suffer an O(B/(B+G)) degradation in performance. Unfortunately, a common case of B >> G makes this an unacceptable state of affairs. In this paper, we present SSN, a “social security network”, as a building block for a secure Internet architecture with the following properties. First, B bad users can degrade the performance of good users by at most O(B/N) where N is the total number of users in the network, and by O(1) in the common case. Second, our proposal is readily implementable with today’s technology and expects only minimal router support in the form of capabilities, a mechanism widely believed to be necessary to address DoS.</div></div></li><br/><li>Shrink: A Cluster Manager for Greening Content Datacenters. <br>Abhigyan Sharma and Xiaozheng Tie and Hardeep Uppal and Arun Venkataramani and David Westbrook and Aditya Yadav and Antonio AA Rocha and Ramesh Sitaraman and Jim Kurose and Dipankar Raychaudhuri and Aditya Mishra and Vikas Kumar and Arun Venkataramani and Joydeep Chandra Abhigyan and Niloy Ganguly <br>Journal : Under submission</li><br/><li><a href='https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ravi_Kokku/publication/239827192_Background_Transfers_with_Minimal_Interference/links/00b7d534c942fa2274000000.pdf'>Background Transfers with Minimal Interference</a> <br>Arun Venkataramani and Ravi Kokku and Mike Dahlin <br>Journal : change, Volume: 6, Number: 20,  <br/><div class='abstract_show_hide'>[+]Show Abstract</div><div class='ab_entry'><div class='abstractentry'>Application performance and availability can be improved by aggressive background replication-distributing data across a network to where it is needed before it is requested.

In this paper , we present a comprehensive experimental evaluation of strategies to control server bandwidth allocation. As part of this effort, we introduce a new model-based control approach that relies on an accurate yet concise " cheat sheet " based on a priori offline measurement to predict swarm performance as a function of the server bandwidth and other swarm parameters. Our evaluation using a prototype system , SwarmServer, instantiating static, dynamic, and model-based controllers shows that static and dynamic controllers can both be suboptimal due to different reasons. In comparison , a model-based approach consistently outperforms both static and dynamic approaches provided it has access to detailed measurements in the regime of interest. Nevertheless , the broad applicability of a model-based approach may be limited in practice because of the overhead of developing and maintaining a comprehensive measurement-based model of swarm performance in each regime of interest.</div></div></li><br/></ul></div></div>
