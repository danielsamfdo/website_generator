<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
In this talk, I will discuss new topics in information theory for data
storage in flash memories. The applications of flash memories have
expanded widely in recent years, and flash memories have become the
dominating member in the family of non-volatile memories. Like
magnetic recording and optical recording, flash memories have their
own distinct properties, including recursive programming, block
erasure, etc. These distinct properties introduce very interesting
coding problems that address many aspects of a successful storage
system, which include efficient data modification, error correction,
high density storage, and more. In this talk, I will introduce some
newly developed codes - such as rewriting codes and rank modulation
codes - and also introduce coding for data movement and wear
leveling. A major theme is understanding how to store information in a
medium where the storage elements have different features when it
transits between its different states.

<h3>About Andrew</h3>

<a href="http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/ajiang/jiang.htm">Anxiao (Andrew) Jiang</a>
has been an assistant professor in the Computer
     Science and Engineering Department of Texas A&amp;M University since
2005. He received his Ph.D. and M.S. in Electrical Engineering at
Caltech and his B.E. in Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua
University. He received the National Science Foundation CAREER Award
for his pioneering work on coding for flash memories. His research
interests include information theory, data storage and algorithm
design.</div>
