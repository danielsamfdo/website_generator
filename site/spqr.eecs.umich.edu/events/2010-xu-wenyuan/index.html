<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
New wireless network systems continue to emerge and have an increasing
impact on our lives, and ultimately become an inseparable part of our
social fabric. Already, we have witnessed medical wireless sensors
monitoring patients at home and RFID-based keys assisting
passive-entry. Despite the high penetration rate of wireless
technologies, the secure precaution of many wireless systems is
limited to security through obscurity. The advances of
software-defined radio make it easy to discover details of wireless
communication protocols, no matter whether they are proprietary or
not, and to launch various attacks causing security or privacy
breaches.  In this talk, we present a case study analyzing the first
mandated in-car sensor networks, the tire pressure monitoring system
(TPMS), using GNU Radio in conjunction with the Universal Software
Radio Peripheral (USRP), a low-cost out-of-shelf software radio
platform.</p>

<p>The security and privacy implications of TPMS are not well understood
as their transmissions propagate beyond the confines of a car's
body. Thus, we evaluated the security and privacy risks associated
with TPMS using both laboratory experiments with isolated tire
pressure sensor modules and experiments with a complete vehicle
system.  The first step towards analyzing the TPMS security and
privacy risks is to reverse-engineer the TPMS communication protocol,
since it is proprietary. We started our reverse engineering effort by
searching for coarse physical characteristics of TPMS communication in
the frequency domain utilizing USRP and vector signal analyzer. Given
the coarse channel information, we tuned the USRP to the correct
frequency band and recorded a few packets at the sample rate of
250Khz.  A post-data-analysis of captured signals by our customized
software revealed the modulation scheme (ASK or FSK) and the encoding
scheme (differential Manchester). Manipulating the sensor to transmit
packets with different readings and spoofing packets using USRP helped
us to determine the message formats and concluded the reverse
engineering process.</p>

<p>Once we understood the TPMS communication protocol, we showed that
eavesdropping is easily possible at a distance of roughly 40m using
cheap antennas. Furthermore, reverse-engineering of the underlying
protocols revealed static 32 bit identifiers and that messages can be
easily triggered remotely, which raises privacy concerns as vehicles
can be tracked through these identifiers. Current protocols do not
employ authentication and vehicle implementations do not perform basic
input validation, thereby allowing for remote spoofing of sensor
messages. We validated this experimentally by triggering tire pressure
warning messages in a moving vehicle from our software radio attack
platform located in a nearby vehicle. Finally, the talk concludes with
a set of recommendations for improving the privacy and security of
tire pressure monitoring systems and other forthcoming consumer
wireless networks.</p>

<h3>About Wenyuan</h3>

<a href="http://www.cse.sc.edu/~wyxu/">Wenyuan Xu</a> is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer
Science and Engineering, University of South Carolina. She received
her Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Rutgers
University in 2007, M.S. degree in computer science and engineering
from Zhejiang University in 2001, and B.S. degree in electrical
engineering with the highest honor from Zhejiang University in
1998. Broadly, her research interests include wireless networking,
network security and privacy. Her prior research results have led to
link-layer jamming detection mechanisms, as well as link-layer defense
strategies to repair networks in the presence of radio
interference. More recently, she is investigating security
vulnerabilities in emerging wireless networks, enhancing privacy in
wireless networks, and developing cross-layer approaches to cope with
jamming attacks.  She received NSF Career Award in 2009 and serves on
the Editorial Board of International Journal of Autonomous and
Adaptive Communications Systems (IJAACS).</div>
