<h2 id="title">&ldquo;Towards Automatic Application of Power Analysis Countermeasures&rdquo;<br />
</h2>

  
<div id="abstract">
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Security is a fundamental feature for today’s embedded systems, however, due to the advent of side channel attacks, satisfying this need is a challenging task. These new, cheaper and faster attacks derive the secret key from the information leaked while data is being processed.  In particular, power analysis attacks are very dangerous since they do not require a deep knowledge of the target device to be effective.</p>

<p>In view of this increasingly relevant problem, this talk proposes a methodology to automate the design of systems characterized by robustness with respect to attacks based on power-related side effects as well as by low-energy consumption and high performances.</p>

<p>More in details, the presented work proposes an infrastructure for bringing the security to the forefront of design variables by associating it with a clear quantitative metric, and shows how such infrastructure can be realized using standard tools. The talk will conclude proposing examples which illustrate the trade off between the security achieved and the cost of several points of the design space.</p>

<h3>Biography</h3>

<a href="http://www.alari.ch/~regaz/">Dr. Francesco Regazzoni</a> is a Postdoctoral researcher at the Crypto Group of the Université Catholique de Louvain (Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium) and at ALaRI Institute of University of Lugano (Lugano, Switzerland). He received the Master of Science degree from  Politecnico di Milano (Italy), and the PhD degree from ALaRI Institute of University of Lugano (Switzerland). His research interests are mainly focused on embedded systems, covering in particular security (especially side channel attacks), VLSI, EDA, operating systems and hardware/software co-design. During his PhD, Francesco has been a visiting researcher at several institutions, including NEC Labs America (Princeton, NJ, USA), the chair for Embedded Security of Ruhr University of Bochum (Bochum, Germany), and the Processor Architecture Laboratory of EPFL (Lausanne, Switzerland).</div>
