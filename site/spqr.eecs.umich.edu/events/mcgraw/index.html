<h2 id="title">&ldquo;Attack Trends 2011&rdquo;<br />
(or: &ldquo;Why Software Security?&rdquo;)</h2>

<div id="abstract">
<h3>Abstract</h3>
In some sense, software is the lifeblood of most modern complex systems.
Software can fail, but worse yet, software can be intentionally made to
fail by attackers.  Instead of defending our systems by isolating them
from the network (an impossible task), we must build security in from the
beginning.  Both social networking and mobile device security provide
important security lessons that can inform a reasoned approach.  Modern
malicious code, including the Zeus Trojan, Stuxnet, and other persistent
web threats, is as sophisticated as it is insidious.  And future trends in
attacks are even more alarming, leveraging rootkits, multi-core attacks,
and hard-to-diagnose timing issues.  Our sole recourse is software
security.  The good news is that we actually know what to do to build
security in.
