  abstract = {Balancing security, privacy, safety, and utility
                  is a necessity in the health care domain, in which
                  implantable medical devices (IMDs) and body area
                  networks (BANs) have made it possible to
                  continuously and automatically manage and treat a
                  number of health conditions.  In this work, we
                  survey publications aimed at improving security and
                  privacy in IMDs and health-related BANs, providing
                  clear definitions and a comprehensive overview of
                  the problem space. We analyze common themes,
                  categorize relevant results, and identify trends and
                  directions for future research. We present a visual
                  illustration of this analysis that shows the
                  progression of IMD/BAN research and highlights
                  emerging threats. We identify three broad research
                  categories aimed at ensuring the security and
                  privacy of the telemetry interface, software, and
                  sensor interface layers and discuss challenges
                  researchers face with respect to ensuring
                  reproducibility of results. We find that while the
                  security of the telemetry interface has received
                  much attention in academia, the threat of software
                  exploitation and the sensor interface layer deserve
                  further attention. In addition, we observe that
                  while the use of physiological values as a source of
                  entropy for cryptographic keys holds some promise, a
                  more rigorous assessment of the security and
                  practicality of these schemes is required.}

  abstract = {To head-off the trend of increasing power con- sumption and throughput overheads due to refresh in DRAM, researchers are exploring ways to fine-tune refresh rate. Refresh management proposals range from temperature-aware refresh to partitioning data cells based on volatility, with each partition having its own refresh rate. One hurdle in this area is the lack of precise description of the evaluation setups used in current proposals. The incomplete descrip- tion makes it difficult to reproduce reproduce results and compare approaches. Thus, it is common for researchers to evaluate their approach using mathe- matical models derived on the experimental results from a disparate set of platforms.
To aide in the evaluation of existing and future ap- proaches for tuning DRAM refresh to save power, this paper provides a reproducible DRAM research plat- form. On this platform, we re-run commonly cited experiments from previous papers in the area. Our experimental results highlight the necessity of a re- producible platform by showing how both assump- tions and experimental outcomes are sensitive to of- ten omitted parameters like temperature and refresh duration.

  abstract = {Electromagnetic interference (EMI) affects
                  circuits by inducing voltages on conductors.  Analog
                  sensing of signals on the order of a few millivolts
                  is particularly sensitive to interference.  This
                  work (1) measures the susceptibility of analog
                  sensor systems to signal injection attacks by
                  intentional, low-power emission of chosen
                  electromagnetic waveforms, and (2) proposes defense
                  mechanisms to reduce the risks.  Our experiments use
                  specially crafted EMI at varying power and distance
                  to measure susceptibility of sensors in implantable
                  medical devices and consumer electronics.  Results
                  show that at distances of 1-2m, consumer electronic
                  devices containing microphones are vulnerable to the
                  injection of bogus audio signals.  Our measurements
                  show that in free air, intentional EMI under 10W can
                  inhibit pacing and induce defibrillation shocks at
                  distances up to 1-2m on implantable cardiac
                  electronic devices.  However, with the sensing leads
                  and medical devices immersed in a saline bath to
                  better approximate the human body, the same
                  experiment decreased to under 5cm.  Our defenses
                  range from prevention with simple analog shielding
                  to detection with a signal contamination metric
                  based on the root mean square of waveform
                  amplitudes.  Our contribution to securing cardiac
                  devices includes a novel defense mechanism that
                  probes for forged pacing pulses inconsistent with
                  the refractory period of cardiac tissue.}

  abstract = {This work analyzes the stochastic behavior of
                  writing to embedded flash memory at voltages lower
                  than recommended by a microcontroller's
                  specifications to reduce energy consumption.  Flash
                  memory integrated within a microcontroller typically
                  requires the entire chip to operate on common supply
                  voltage almost double what the CPU portion requires.
                  Our approach tolerates a lower supply voltage so
                  that the CPU may operate in a more energy efficient
                  manner.  Energy efficient coding algorithms then
                  cope with flash memory that behaves unpredictably.
                  Our software-only coding algorithms (in-place
                  writes, multiple-place writes, RS-Berger codes)
                  enable reliable storage at low voltages on
                  unmodified hardware by exploiting the electrically
                  cumulative nature of half-written data in write-once
                  bits.  For a sensor monitoring application using the
                  MSP430, coding with in-place writes reduces the
                  overall energy consumption by 34\%.  In-place writes
                  are competitive when the time spent on computation
                  is at least four times greater than the time spent
                  on writes to flash memory.  Our evaluation shows
                  that tightly maintaining the digital abstraction for
                  storage in embedded flash memory comes at a
                  significant cost to energy consumption with minimal
                  gain in reliability.}

  abstract = {Transiently powered computing devices such as RFID tags, kinetic
	energy harvesters, and smart cards typically rely on programs that
	complete a task under tight time constraints before energy starvation
	leads to complete loss of volatile memory.  Mementos is a software
	system that transforms general-purpose programs into interruptible
	computations that are protected from frequent power losses by
	automatic, energy-aware state checkpointing.  Mementos comprises a
	collection of optimization passes for the LLVM compiler infrastructure
	and a linkable library that exercises hardware support for energy
	measurement while managing state checkpoints stored in nonvolatile
	memory.  We evaluate Mementos against diverse test cases in a
	trace-driven simulator of transiently powered RFID-scale devices.
	Although Mementos's energy checks increase run time when energy is
	plentiful, they allow Mementos to safely suspend execution when energy
	dwindles, effectively spreading computation across zero or more power
	failures.  This paper's contributions are: a study of the runtime
	environment for programs on RFID-scale devices; an energy-aware state
	checkpointing system for these devices that is implemented for the
	MSP430 family of microcontrollers; and a trace-driven simulator of
	transiently powered RFID-scale devices.}

  abstract = {Passive RFID tags harvest their operating energy from an interrogating reader, but constant energy shortfalls severely limit their computational and storage capabilities. We propose Cryptographic Computational Continuation Passing (CCCP), a mechanism that amplifies programmable passive RFID tags' capabilities by exploiting an often overlooked, plentiful resource: low-power radio communication.  While radio communication is more energy intensive than flash memory writes in many embedded devices, we show that the reverse is true for passive RFID tags.  A tag can use CCCP to checkpoint its computational state to an untrusted reader using less energy than an equivalent flash write, thereby allowing it to devote a greater share of its energy to computation.  Security is the major challenge in such remote checkpointing. Using scant and fleeting energy, a tag must enforce confidentiality, authenticity, integrity, and data freshness while communicating with potentially untrustworthy infrastructure.  Our contribution synthesizes well-known cryptographic and low-power techniques with a novel flash memory storage strategy, resulting in a secure remote storage facility for an emerging class of devices.  Our evaluation of CCCP consists of energy measurements of a prototype implementation on the batteryless, MSP430-based WISP platform.  Our experiments show that---despite cryptographic overhead---remote checkpointing consumes less energy than checkpointing to flash for data sizes above roughly 64 bytes.  CCCP enables secure and flexible remote storage that would otherwise outstrip batteryless RFID tags' resources.}

  abstract = {Lack of a locally trustworthy clock makes security protocols challenging to implement on batteryless embedded devices such as contact smartcards, contactless smartcards, and RFID tags. A device that knows how much time has elapsed between queries from an untrusted reader could better protect against attacks that depend on the existence of a rate-unlimited encryption oracle. The TARDIS (Time and Remanence Decay in SRAM) helps to locally maintain a sense of time elapsed without power and without special-purpose hardware. The TARDIS software computes the expiration state of a timer by analyzing the decay of existing on-chip SRAM memory. The TARDIS enables coarse-grained, hourglass-like timers such that cryptographic software can more deliberately decide how to throttle its response rate. Our experiments demonstrate that the TARDIS can measure time ranging from seconds to several hours depending on hardware parameters. Key challenges to implementing a practical TARDIS include compensating for temperature and handling variation across hardware. Our contributions are (1) the algorithmic building blocks for computing elapsed time from SRAM decay; (2) characterizing TARDIS behavior under different temperatures, capacitors, SRAM sizes, and chips; and (3) three proof of concept implementations that use the TARDIS to enable privacy-preserving RFID tags, to deter double swiping of contactless credit cards, and to increase the difficulty of brute force attacks against e-Passports.}

  abstract = {Physical uncloneable functions (PUFs) produce outputs that are a function of minute random physical variations. Promoted for low-cost authentication and resistance to counterfeiting, many varieties of PUFs have been used to enhance the security and privacy of RFID tags. To different extents, applications for both identification and authentication require a PUF to produce a consistent output over time. As the sensing of minute variations is a fundamentally noisy process, much effort is spent on error correction of PUF outputs. We propose a new variant of PUF that uses well-understood properties of common memory cells as a fingerprint. Our method of fingerprinting SRAM cells by their data retention voltage improves the success rate of identification by 28.3% over fingerprints based on power-up state alone.}

  abstract = {The trend toward energy-proportional computing, in which power consumption scales closely with workload, is making computers increasingly vulnerable to information leakage via whole-system power analysis. Saving energy is an unqualified boon for computer operators, but this trend has produced an unintentional side effect: it is becoming easier to identify computing activities in power traces because idle-power reduction has lowered the effective noise floor. This paper offers preliminary evidence that the analysis of AC power traces can be both harmful to privacy and beneficial for malware detection, the latter of which may benefit embedded (e.g., medical) devices.},

  abstract = {The price of Internet services is user information, and many pay it without hesitation. While myriad privacy tools exist that thwart the detailed compilation of information about user habits, these tools often assume that reduced functionality is always justified by increased privacy. In contrast, we propose the adoption of functional privacy as a guiding principle in the development of new privacy tools. Functional privacy has the overarching goal of maintaining all functionality while improving privacy as much as practically possible --- rather than forcing users to make decisions about tradeoffs that they may not fully understand. As a concrete example of a functional privacy approach, we implemented Milk, a Google Chrome extension that automatically rewrites HTTP cookies to strictly bind them to the first-party domains from which they were set. We also identify existing privacy-preserving tools that we believe embody the principle of functional privacy and discuss the limitations of others.},

  abstract = {Computers plugged into power outlets leak identifiable information
	by drawing variable amounts of power when performing different tasks. This
	work examines the extent to which this side channel leaks private information
	about web browsing to an observer taking measurements at the power outlet.
	Using direct measurements of AC power consumption with an instrumented outlet,
	we construct a classifier that correctly identifies unlabeled power traces of
	webpage activity from a set of 51 candidates with 99% precision and 99%
	recall.  The classifier rejects samples of $441$ pages outside the corpus with
	a false-positive rate of less than 2%.  It is also robust to a number of
	variations in webpage loading conditions, including encryption.  When trained
	on power traces from two computers loading the same webpage, the classifier
	correctly labels further traces of that webpage from either computer.  We
	identify several reasons for this consistently recognizable power consumption,
	including system calls, and propose countermeasures to limit the leakage of
	private information.  Characterizing the AC power side channel may help lead
	to practical countermeasures that protect user privacy from an untrustworthy
	power infrastructure.},

  abstract = {Embedded systems are ubiquitous, connect to networks, and
	increasingly use off-the-shelf operating systems vulnerable to malware. Yet,
	strict validation processes make it difficult or too costly to use anti-virus
	software or automated operating system updates in embedded systems such as
	medical devices. Our WattsUpDoc system uses a traditionally undesirable
	side channel of power consumption to enable run-time malware detection. Our
	measurements show that WattsUpDoc can detect previously known malware with at
	least 94% accuracy and previously unknown malware with at least 85% accuracy
	on the devices we tested. While the detection rates are similar to that of
	conventional malware-detection systems, WattsUpDoc requires no hardware or
	software modification or network communication.},
