Most prior efforts have focused on attacks that can be addressed using traditional cryptographic techniques to ensure authentication or integrity, e.g., BGPSec and related works. Although augmenting BGP with authentication and integrity mechanisms is critical, they are, by design, far from sufficient to prevent attacks based on manipulating the complex BGP protocol itself. In this paper, we identify two serious attacks on two of the most fundamental goals of BGP-to ensure reachability and to enable ASes to pick routes available to them according to their routing policies-even in the presence of BGPSec-like mechanisms. Our key contributions are to (1) formalize a series of critical security properties, (2) experimentally validate using commodity router implementations that BGP fails to achieve those properties, (3) quantify the extent of these vulnerabilities in the Internet's AS topology, and (4) propose simple modifications to provably ensure that those properties are satisfied. Our experiments show that, using our attacks, a single malicious AS can cause thousands of other ASes to become disconnected from thousands of other ASes for arbitrarily long, while our suggested modifications almost completely eliminate such attacks.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@article{DBLP:journals/ton/SongVG16,<br> author = {Yang Song and Arun Venkataramani and Lixin Gao},<br> bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, http://dblp.org},<br> biburl = {http://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/bib/journals/ton/SongVG16},<br>  doi = {10.1109/TNET.2015.2503642},<br> journal = {{IEEE/ACM} Trans.

In this paper, we present the design and implementation of msocket, a system that allows communicating endpoints to move across network locations arbitrarily while maintaining disruption-tolerant connectivity without any change to legacy operating systems or network infrastructure. msocket supports pre-lookup, connect-time, individual, and simultaneous mobility of one or both endpoints across multihomed network addresses, and enables seamless mobile-to-mobile communication despite the presence of address-translating middleboxes. We have implemented msocket as a user-level socket library and our evaluation shows that: (1) msocket recovers from mobility of one or both endpoint(s) in roughly two round-trips; (2) msocket's multipath scheduler greatly enhances user-perceived performance or power consumption in multihomed settings; and (3) msocket imposes little additional overhead over traditional TCP/IP sockets.</div></div></li><h5>2015</h5><li><a href='http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218453'>Measurement and modeling of user transitioning among networks</a><br/> Sookhyun Yang and Jim Kurose and Simon Heimlicher and Arun Venkataramani, <br/>2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications, INFOCOM

Physical mobility, however, differs from user identity (name) mobility in both traditional mobility management protocols such as Mobile-IP and in new architectures, such as XIA and MobilityFirst, that support identity mobility and location independence as first class objects. A multi-homed stationary user or a stationary user shifting among multiple devices attached to different networks will persistently keep his/her identity but will change access networks and the IP address to which his/her identity is associated. We perform a measurement study of such user transitioning among networks from a network-level point of view, characterizing the sequence of networks to which a user is attached and discuss insights and implications drawn from these measurements. We characterize network transitioning in terms of network residency time, degree of multi-homing, transition rates and more. We find that users typically spend time attached to a small number of access networks, and that a surprisingly large number of users access two networks contemporaneously. We develop and validate a parsimonious Markov chain model of canonical user transitioning among networks that can be used to provision network services and to analyze mobility protocols.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{DBLP:conf/infocom/YangKHV15,<br> author = {Sookhyun Yang and Jim Kurose and Simon Heimlicher and Arun Venkataramani},<br> bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, http://dblp.org},<br> biburl = {http://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/bib/conf/infocom/YangKHV15},<br> booktitle = {2015 {IEEE} Conference on Computer Communications, {INFOCOM}<br>2015, Kowloon, Hong Kong, April 26 - May 1, 2015},<br>  crossref = {DBLP:conf/infocom/2015},<br> doi = {10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218453},<br> link = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218453},<br> pages = {828--836},<br> timestamp = {Tue, 01 Sep 2015 14:37:13 +0200},<br> title = {Measurement and modeling of user transitioning among networks},<br> year = {2015}<br>}<br><br></div></div></li><h5>2014</h5><li><a href='http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2656877.2656888'>MobilityFirst: a mobility-centric and trustworthy internet architecture</a><br/> Arun Venkataramani and James F.

MobilityFirst enhances mobility by cleanly separating names or identifiers from addresses or network locations, and enhances security by representing both in an intrinsically verifiable manner, relying upon a massively scalable, distributed, global name service to bind names and addresses, and to facilitate services including device-to-service, multicast, anycast, and context-aware communication, content retrieval, and more.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive experimental evaluation of strategies to control server bandwidth allocation. As part of this effort, we introduce a new model-based control approach that relies on an accurate yet concise “cheat sheet” based on a priori offline measurement to predict swarm performance as a function of the server bandwidth and other swarm parameters. Our evaluation using a prototype system, SwarmServer, instantiating static, dynamic, and model-based controllers shows that static and dynamic controllers can both be suboptimal due to different reasons. In comparison, a model-based approach consistently outperforms both static and dynamic approaches provided it has access to detailed measurements in the regime of interest. Nevertheless, the broad applicability of a model-based approach may be limited in practice because of the overhead of developing and maintaining a comprehensive measurement-based model of swarm performance in each regime of interest.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{DBLP:conf/comsnets/SharmaVR14,<br> author = {Abhigyan Sharma and Arun Venkataramani and Antonio A.

In this paper we consider distributed clouds that host virtual desktops(VDs) which are then accessed by their users through remote desktop protocols. VDs have different sensitivities to latency, primarily determined by the types of applications running (games or video players are more sensitive to latency) and the end users' locations. We design VMShadow, a system to automatically optimize the location and performance of latency-sensitive VDs in the cloud. VMShadow performs black-box fingerprinting of a VM's network traffic to infer its latency-sensitivity and employs a greedy heuristic based algorithm to move highly latency-sensitive VMs to cloud sites that are closer to their end users. VMShadow employs WAN-based live migration and a new network connection migration protocol to ensure that the VM migration and subsequent changes to the VM's network address are transparent to end-users. We implement a prototype of VMShadow in a nested hypervisor and demonstrate its effectiveness for optimizing the performance of VM-based desktops in the cloud. Our experiments on a private and the public EC2 cloud show that VMShadow is able to discriminate between latency-sensitive and insensitive desktop applications and judiciously move only those VMs that will benefit the most. For desktop VMs with video activity, VMShadow improves VNC's refresh rate by 90%. Further our connection migration proxy, which utilizes dynamic rewriting of packet headers, imposes a rewriting overhead of only 13μs per packet. Trans-continental VM migrations take about 4 minutes.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{DBLP:conf/mmsys/GuoGRSVL14,<br> author = {Tian Guo and Vijay Gopalakrishnan and K.

Our approach is empirical and is based on real Internet topologies, routing tables from real routers, and a measured workload of the mobility of devices and content across network addresses today. We measure the extent of network mobility exhibited by mobile devices with a home-brewn Android app deployed on hundreds of smartphones, and measure the network mobility of Internet content from distributed vantage points. We combine this measured data with our quantitative methodology to analyze the different cost-benefit tradeoffs struck by location-independent network architectures with respect to routing update cost, path stretch, and forwarding table size. We find that more than 20% of users change over 10 IP addresses a day, suggesting that mobility is the norm rather than the exception, so intrinsic and efficient network support for mobility is critical. We also find that with purely name-based routing approaches, each event involving the mobility of a device or popular content may result in an update at up to 14% of Internet routers; but, the fraction of impacted routers is much smaller for the long tail of unpopular content. These results suggest that recent proposals for pure name-based networking are suitable for highly aggregateable content that does not move frequently but may need to be augmented with addressing-assisted approaches to handle device mobility.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/GaoVKH14,<br> author = {Zhaoyu Gao and Arun Venkataramani and James F.

A number of these shortcomings can be traced back to naming. The current Internet uses IP addresses to conflate identity and network location, which results in poor support for mobility and multihoming; vulnerability to hijacking and spoofing of addresses, etc. The Internet's name resolution infrastructure deeply embeds in its design the assumption of mostly stationary hosts and poorly satisfies the performance, security, and functionality demanded by modern mobile services. As a step towards addressing these shortcomings, we present the design of a global name service that forms a central component of the MobilityFirst, a clean-slate Internet architecture with mobility and trustworthiness as principal design goals. MobilityFirst relies on the global name service to cleanly separate identity from network location and to resolve identifiers to locations in a secure manner. More importantly, MobilityFirst capitalizes on the role of the name resolution infrastructure as a logically central, first point of contact to significantly enhance a number of network-layer functions such as supporting host and network mobility, multi-homed traffic engineering, content retrieval, multicast, and next-generation context-aware services. This paper identifies key challenges that must be addressed to realize such a vision and outlines the design of a distributed global name service that can resolve identifiers to dynamic attributes in a fast, consistent, and cost-effective manner at Internet scales.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{DBLP:conf/comsnets/VenkataramaniSTUWKR13,<br> author = {Arun Venkataramani and Abhigyan Sharma and Xiaozheng Tie and Hardeep Uppal and David Westbrook and Jim Kurose and Dipankar Raychaudhuri},<br> bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, http://dblp.org},<br> biburl = {http://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/bib/conf/comsnets/<br>VenkataramaniSTUWKR13},<br> booktitle = {Fifth International Conference on Communication Systems and<br>Networks, {COMSNETS} 2013, Bangalore, India, January 7-10, 2013},<br>  crossref = {DBLP:conf/comsnets/2013},<br> doi = {10.1109/COMSNETS.2013.6465579},<br> link = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/COMSNETS.2013.6465579},<br> pages = {1--9},<br> timestamp = {Mon, 25 Feb 2013 15:54:43 +0100},<br> title = {Design requirements of a global name service for a mobility- centric, trustworthy internetwork},<br> year = {2013}<br>}<br><br></div></div></li><li><a href='http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2013.32'>Identifying and Addressing Protocol Manipulation Attacks in "Secure" BGP</a><br/> Yang Song and Arun Venkataramani and Lixin Gao, <br/>IEEE 33rd International Conference on Distributed Computing

These prior efforts have largely focused on attacks that can be addressed using traditional cryptographic mechanisms to ensure authentication or integrity (e.g., S-BGP). Although augmenting BGP with authentication and integrity mechanisms is critical, it is far from sufficient to prevent attacks based on manipulating the complex BGP protocol itself. In this paper, we identify two serious protocol manipulation attacks that undermine the two most fundamental goals of the BGP control plane -- to ensure reachability and enable ASes to pick routes according to their routing policies -- despite the presence of S-BGP-like mechanisms. Our key contributions are to (1) formalize two critical security properties, (2) experimentally validate using commodity router implementations that BGP fails to achieve them, (3) quantify the extent of the resulting vulnerabilities in the Internet's AS topology, and (4) design and implement simple modifications to provably ensure that those properties are satisfied. Our experiments show that, a single malicious AS can cause thousands of other ASes to become disconnected from thousands of other ASes for arbitrarily long, while our proposed modifications almost completely eliminates such attacks.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{DBLP:conf/icdcs/SongVG13,<br> author = {Yang Song and Arun Venkataramani and Lixin Gao},<br> bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, http://dblp.org},<br> biburl = {http://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/bib/conf/icdcs/SongVG13},<br> booktitle = {{IEEE} 33rd International Conference on Distributed Computing<br>Systems, {ICDCS} 2013, 8-11 July, 2013, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {USA}},<br>  crossref = {DBLP:conf/icdcs/2013},<br> doi = {10.1109/ICDCS.2013.32},<br> link = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2013.32},<br> pages = {550--559},<br> timestamp = {Thu, 11 Dec 2014 17:34:06 +0100},<br> title = {Identifying and Addressing Protocol Manipulation Attacks in "Secure" BGP},<br> year = {2013}<br>}<br><br></div></div></li><li><a href='http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2013.6562871'>On the CDN pricing game</a><br/> Yang Song and Arun Venkataramani and Lixin Gao, <br/>2013 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM Workshops, Turin, Italy, April

In this paper, we formulate a game-theoretic model to analyze price competition among CDNs. Under this model, we propose an optimal strategy employed by two-CDN games. The strategy is incentive-compatible since any CDN that deviates from the strategy ends up with a lower utility. The strategy is also efficient since it produces a total utility that is at least two thirds of the social optimal utility.

After briefly outlining the original design goals of the project, we provide a discussion of the main architectural concepts behind the network design, identifying key features such as separation of names from addresses, public-key based globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) for named objects, global name resolution service (GNRS) for dynamic binding of names to addresses, storage-aware routing and late binding, content- and context-aware services, optional in-network compute layer, and so on.

Example of specific advanced services supported by the protocol stack, including multi-homing, mobility with disconnection, and content retrieval/caching are given for illustration. Further design details of two key protocol components, the GNRS name resolution service and the GSTAR routing protocol, are also described along with sample results from evaluation.

Our evaluation using a prototype system, SwarmServer, instantiating static, dynamic, and model-based controllers shows that static and dynamic controllers can both be suboptimal due to different reasons.

To bridge this disparity, BlockRate employs multiple bitrates within a block that are predictive of future channel conditions.

In data centers where multiple applications share a physical server, ZZ reduces the aggregate number of execution replicas running in the data center, improving throughput and response times.

The primary focus of these mechanisms is to increase the likelihood of finding a path with limited information, and so these approaches have only an incidental effect on such routing metrics as maximum or average delivery delay. In this paper, we present RAPID, an intentional DTN routing protocol that can optimize a specific routing metric such as the worst-case delivery delay or the fraction of packets that are delivered within a deadline. The key insight is to treat DTN routing as a resource allocation problem that translates the routing metric into per-packet utilities that determine how packets should be replicated in the system. We evaluate RAPID rigorously through a prototype deployed over a vehicular DTN testbed of 40 buses and simulations based on real traces.

By leveraging resources provided by clients, swarming systems reduce the load on and costs to publishers. However, there is a limit to how much cost savings can be gained from swarming; for example, for unpopular content peers will always depend on the publisher in order to complete their downloads. In this paper, we investigate this dependence. For this purpose, we propose a new metric, namely swarm self-sustainability. A swarm is referred to as self-sustaining if all its blocks are collectively held by peers; the self-sustainability of a swarm is the fraction of time in which the swarm is self-sustaining. We pose the following question: how does the self-sustainability of a swarm vary as a function of content popularity, the service capacity of the users, and the size of the file? We present a model to answer the posed question. We then propose efficient solution methods to compute self-sustainability. The accuracy of our estimates is validated against simulation. Finally, we also provide closed-form expressions for the fraction of time that a given number of blocks is collectively held by peers.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{ESS,<br> author = {Daniel S.

We find that the average 3G and WiFi availability across the cities is 87% and 11%, respectively. WiFi throughput is lower than 3G through-put, and WiFi loss rates are higher. We then design a system, called Wiffler, to augments mobile 3G capacity. It uses two key ideas leveraging delay tolerance and fast switching -- to overcome the poor availability and performance of WiFi. For delay tolerant applications, Wiffler uses a simple model of the environment to predict WiFi connectivity. It uses these predictions to delays transfers to offload more data on WiFi, but only if delaying reduces 3G usage and the transfers can be completed within the application's tolerance threshold. For applications that are extremely sensitive to delay or loss (e.g., VoIP), Wiffler quickly switches to 3G if WiFi is unable to successfully transmit the packet within a small time window. We implement and deploy Wiffler in our vehicular testbed. Our experiments show that Wiffler significantly reduces 3G usage.

Using this model, we develop TailEnder, a protocol that reduces energy consumption of common mobile applications. For applications that can tolerate a small delay such as e-mail, TailEnder schedules transfers so as to minimize the cumulative energy consumed meeting user-specified deadlines. We show that the TailEnder scheduling algorithm is within a factor 2x of the optimal and show that any online algorithm can at best be within a factor 1.62x of the optimal.

We evaluate the benefits of TailEnder for three different case study applications - email, news feeds, and web search - based on real user logs and show significant reduction in energy consumption in each case.

However, the ubiquity and low cost of WiFi suggests an attractive alternative, namely, opportunistic use of open WiFi access points (APs) or planned municipal mesh networks. Unfortunately, for vehicular users, the intermittent nature of WiFi connectivity makes it challenging to support popular interactive applications such as Web search and browsing. Our work is driven by two questions. 1) How can we enable system support for interactive web applications to tolerate disruptions in WiFi connectivity from mobile nodes? 2) Can opportunistic mobile-to-mobile (m2m) transfers enhance application performance over only using APs, and if so, under what conditions and by how much? We present Thedu, a system that enables access to Web search from moving vehicles. The key idea is to use aggressive prefetching to transform the interactive Web search application into a one-shot request/response process. We deployed a prototype of Thedu on the DieselNet testbed in Amherst, MA, consisting of transit buses averaging 21 on the road at a time. Our deployment results show that Thedu can deliver 4 times as many relevant web pages than not using Thedu. A bus receives relevant web pages with a mean delay of 2.3 minutes and within 0.55 minutes in areas with high AP density. Thedu augments AP connectivity with m2m transfers using a utility-driven DTN routing algorithm and uses caching to exploit query locality. Our analytic model and trace-driven simulations suggest that m2m routing yields little benefit over using APs alone even under moderately dense AP deployment such as in Amherst. With sparsely deployed APs as may be the case in rural areas, our conclusions are more mixed: m2m routing with caching improves the number of relevant responses delivered per bus by up to 58%, but the mean delay is significantly high at 6.7 minutes, calling into question its practicality for interactive applications.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{thedu-mobicom,<br> author = {Aruna Balasubramanian and Brian N.

A router applies a received update immediately to its forwarding table before propagating the update to other routers, including those that potentially depend upon the outcome of the update. Responsiveness comes at the cost of routing loops and blackholes-a router A thinks its route to a destination is via B but B disagrees. By favoring responsiveness (a liveness property) over consistency (a safety property), Internet routing has lost both. Our position is that consistent state in a distributed system makes its behavior more predictable and securable. To this end, we present consensus routing, a consistency-first approach that cleanly separates safety and liveness using two logically distinct modes of packet delivery: a stable mode where a route is adopted only after all dependent routers have agreed upon it, and a transient mode that heuristically forwards the small fraction of packets that encounter failed links. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that consensus routing improves overall availability when used in conjunction with existing transient mode heuristics such as backup paths, deflections, or detouring.

The primary focus of these mechanisms is to increase the likelihood of finding a path with limited information, so these approaches have only an incidental effect on such routing metrics as maximum or average delivery latency. In this paper, we present RAPID, an intentional DTN routing protocol that can optimize a specific routing metric such as worst-case delivery latency or the fraction of packets that are delivered within a deadline. The key insight is to treat DTN routing as a resource allocation problem that translates the routing metric into per-packet utilities which determine how packets should be replicated in the system. We evaluate RAPID rigorously through a prototype of RAPID deployed over a vehicular DTN testbed of 40 buses and simulations based on real traces. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to report on a routing protocol deployed on a real DTN at this scale. Our results suggest that RAPID significantly outperforms existing routing protocols for several metrics. We also show empirically that for small loads RAPID is within 10% of the optimal performance.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{RAPID,<br> author = {Aruna Balasubramanian and Brian N.

Our study analyzes the prevalence and impact of two recent trends to improve BitTorrent availability: (i) use of multiple trackers, and (ii) use of Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs), both of which also help to balance load better. The study considered more than 1,400 trackers and 24,000 DHT nodes (extracted from about 20,000 torrents) over a period of two months.

However, applications might desire path properties between arbitary end-hosts. Hence, iPlane exports a query interface through which applications can request predictions of path properties between arbitrary end-hosts. • Applications can choose to upload to iPlane a few (typically 10) traceroutes outgoing from their clients. The traceroutes from a client help iPlane capture the routing diversity near that client for better predicting the performance of paths from it. While this information improves prediction accuracy, iPlane can also operate without having this information. iPlane maintains a database-like view of path properties between pairs of end-hosts. For every source-destination pair, there exists a row in the view with iPlane’s predicted path between these hosts and the predicted performance of the path. Any query to iPlane involves an SQL-like query on this view – selecting some rows and columns, joining the view with itself, sorting rows based on values in certain columns, and so on. We provide tools that applications can use for interacting with iPlane. We also make the source code for all our tools publicly available.

Though replication has several benefits for large-scale systems distributed across wide-area networks, it also introduces considerable complexity over a centralized unreplicated system. This thesis contributes mechanisms and algorithms that enable the design of simpler and more efficient large-scale replicated systems. On the mechanism front, we present aggressive speculative replication (ASR) as a basic primitive in building large-scale replicated systems. ASR refers to aggressively trading-off costs of hardware resources for making replicas of content and updates in a speculative manner in return for savings in human time and improved service quality. Today, replicated systems are unable to avail of the benefits of ASR as current architectures rely on manually-tuned parameters to manage the complexity of large-scale replicated systems. Consequently, such systems are hard to build and maintain, inefficient in utilizing available resources, and prone to the risk of overload. As a solution, we present an architecture, Mars, that performs ASR in a self-tuning manner, i.e. without the need for manual tuning. To enable realization of Mars' architecture in practical systems, we build TCP Nice, an end-to-end transport protocol for background transfers. We demonstrate the benefits of Mars through a case study of a Web prefetching system, NPS, and show that the Mars approach simplifies the design, efficiently uses available resources to give performance benefits, is robust to the risk of system overload, and is easily deployable without changing existing infrastructure by using only simple end-to-end mechanisms. On the algorithmic front, we make three contributions. First, we present a speculative replication algorithm, namely, long-term prefetching, to minimize average response times at a large cache constrained by bandwidth and validate its effectiveness through simulations using Web traces. Next, we develop a speculative replication algorithm for minimizing response times in a set of hierarchically-organized distributed cooperating caches constrained by bandwidth, and show that it is constant-competitive. Finally, we study the theoretically intriguing problem of minimizing average response times in a set of hierarchically-organized distributed cooperating caches constrained by storage space and show a nonconstant lower bound on the competitive ratio of any online algorithm that is allowed at most a constant-factor space advantage.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@phdthesis{phd-thesis,<br> author = {Arun Venkataramani},<br>  institution = {Computer Sciences, University of Texas at Austin},<br> link = {http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/arun_phdthesis.pdf},<br> month = {December},<br> title = {Mechanisms and Algorithms for Large-Scale Replication Systems},<br> year = {2004}<br>}<br><br></div></div></li><li><a href='http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/ohcc-TR.pdf'>Online Hierarchical Cooperative Caching</a><br/> Xiaozhou Li and C.

In the hierarchical cooperative caching problem, a set of n machines residing in an ultrametric space cooperate with one another to satisfy a sequence of read requests to a collection of (read-only) files. A seminal result in the area of competitive analysis states that LRU (the widelyused deterministic online paging algorithm based on the “least recently used” eviction policy) is constant-competitive if it is given a constant-factor blowup in capacity over the offline algorithm. Does such a constant-competitive deterministic algorithm (with a constant-factor blowup in the machine capacities) exist for the hierarchical cooperative caching problem? The main contribution of the present paper is to answer this question in the negative. More specifi- cally, we establish an Ω(log log n) lower bound on the competitive ratio of any online hierarchical cooperative caching algorithm with capacity blowup O((log n)^1−ε), where ε denotes an arbitrarily small positive constant.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{ohcc-spaa,<br> author = {Xiaozhou Li and C.

This separation yields two fundamental and practically significant advantages over previous architectures. First, it reduces replication costs because the new architecture can tolerate faults in up to half of the state machine replicas that execute requests. Previous systems can tolerate faults in at most a third of the combined agreement/state machine replicas. Second, separating agreement from execution allows a general privacy firewall architecture to protect confidentiality through replication. In contrast, replication in previous systems hurts confidentiality because exploiting the weakest replica can be sufficient to compromise the system. We have constructed a prototype and evaluated it running both microbenchmarks and an NFS server. Overall, we find that the architecture adds modest latencies to unreplicated systems and that its performance is competitive with existing Byzantine fault tolerant systems.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{separating-sosp,<br> author = {Jian Yin and Jean-Philippe Martin and Arun Venkataramani and Lorenzo Alvisi and Mike Dahlin},<br> booktitle = {ACM SOSP},<br>  link = {http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/separation-sosp.pdf},<br> location = {Bolton Landing, NY, USA},<br> month = {October},<br> pages = {253--267},<br> title = {Separating Agreement from Execution for Byzantine Fault Tolerant Services},<br> year = {2003}<br>}<br><br></div></div></li><li><a href='http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/nps-usits.pdf'>A Non-Interfering Deployable Web Prefetching System</a><br/> Ravi Kokku and Praveen Yalagandula and Arun Venkataramani and Mike Dahlin, <br/>USENIX Symposium on Internet Technologies and Systems (USITS), March 2003 <br/><div class='abstract_show_hide'>[+]Show Abstract</div><div class='ab_entry'><div class='abstractentry'>We present Prefetch-Nice, a novel non-intrusive web prefetching system that (1) systematically avoids interference between prefetch and demand requests at the server as well as in the network by utilizing only spare resources, and (2) is deployable without any modifications to the browsers, the HTTP protocol and the network. Prefetch-Nice's self-tuning architecture eliminates the necessity of the traditional "threshold" magic numbers typically used to limit intereference, thereby allowing applications to improve bene ts and reduce the risk of aggressive prefetching.

However, given the rapid fluctuations of available network bandwidth and changing resource costs due to technology trends, hand tuning the aggressiveness of background transfers risks (1) complicating applications, (2) being too aggressive and interfering with other applications, and (3) being too timid and not gaining the benefits of background transfers. Our goal is for the operating system to manage network resources in order to provide a simple abstraction of near zero-cost background transfers. Our system, TCP Nice, can provably bound the interference inflicted by background flows on foreground flows in a restricted network model. And our microbenchmarks and case study applications suggest that in practice it interferes little with foreground flows, reaps a large fraction of spare network bandwidth, and simplifies application construction and deployment. For example, in our prefetching case study application, aggressive prefetching improves demand performance by a factor of three when Nice manages resources; but the same prefetching hurts demand performance by a factor of six under standard network congestion control.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{tcp-nice-osdi,<br> author = {Arun Venkataramani and Ravi Kokku and Mike Dahlin},<br> booktitle = {USENIX OSDI},<br>  link = {http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/tcp-nice-osdi.pdf},<br> month = {December},<br> title = {TCP Nice: A Mechanism for Background Transfers},<br> year = {2002}<br>}<br><br></div></div></li><li><a href='http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/massive-replication.pdf'>Operating System Support for Massive Replication</a><br/> Arun Venkataramani and Ravi Kokku and Mike Dahlin, <br/>Proceedings of the ACM SIGOPS European Workshop, Saint-Emilion, France, September 2002 <br/><div class='abstract_show_hide'>[+]Show Abstract</div><div class='ab_entry'><div class='abstractentry'>This paper first argues that operating systems should provide support for massive replication of data and services.
