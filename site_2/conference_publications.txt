The recent IC scheduling theory focuses on these sources of unpredictability by crafting schedules that maximize the number of executable jobs at every point in time. In this paper, we experimentally investigate the key question: does IC scheduling yield significant positive benefits for real IC? To this end, we develop a realistic computation model to match jobs to client machines and conduct extensive simulations to compare IC-optimal schedules against popular, intuitively compelling heuristics. Our results suggest that for a large range of computation-dags, client availability patterns, and two quite different performance metrics, IC-optimal schedules significantly outperform schedules produced by popular heuristics, by as much as 10-20%.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@proceedings{IC,<br> author = {Rob Hall and Arnold Rosenberg and Arun Venkataramani},<br> booktitle = {IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS)},<br>  link = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4227973/},<br> month = {March},<br> title = {A Comparison of DAG Scheduling Strategies for Internet-Based Computing},<br> year = {2007}<br>}<br><br></div></div></li><br/><li><a href='http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/BT_availability.pdf'>Availability in BitTorrent Systems</a><br/> Giovanni Neglia and Giuseppe Reina and Honggang Zhang and Donald Towsley and Arun Venkataramani and John Danaher, <br/>IEEE INFOCOM, May 2007 <br/><div class='abstract_show_hide'>[+]Show Abstract</div><div class='ab_entry'><div class='abstractentry'>In this paper, we investigate the problem of highly available, massive-scale file distribution in the Internet. To this end, we conduct a large-scale measurement study of BitTorrent, a popular class of systems that use swarms of actively downloading peers to assist each other in file distribution. The first generation of BitTorrent systems used a central tracker to enable coordination among peers, resulting in low availability due to the tracker's single point of failure. Our study analyzes the prevalence and impact of two recent trends to improve BitTorrent availability: (i) use of multiple trackers, and (ii) use of Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs), both of which also help to balance load better. The study considered more than 1,400 trackers and 24,000 DHT nodes (extracted from about 20,000 torrents) over a period of two months. We find that both trends improve availability, but for different and somewhat unexpected reasons. Our findings include: (i) multiple trackers improve availability, but the improvement largely comes from the choice of a single highly available tracker, (ii) such improvement is reduced by the presence of correlated failures, (iii) multiple trackers can significantly reduce the connectivity of the overlay formed by peers, (iv) the DHT improves information availability, but induces a higher response latency to peer queries.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{BTavailability,<br> author = {Giovanni Neglia and Giuseppe Reina and Honggang Zhang and Donald Towsley and Arun Venkataramani and John Danaher},<br> booktitle = {IEEE INFOCOM},<br>  link = {http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/BT_availability.pdf},<br> month = {May},<br> title = {Availability in BitTorrent Systems},<br> year = {2007}<br>}<br><br></div></div></li><br/><li><a href='http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/harp.pdf'>A Multipath Background Network Architecture</a><br/> Ravi Kokku and Aniruddha Bohra and Samrat Ganguly and Arun Venkataramani, <br/>IEEE INFOCOM, May 2007,<br/>Extended <a href=http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/harp_extended.pdf> techreport </a> with full proofs <br/><div class='abstract_show_hide'>[+]Show Abstract</div><div class='ab_entry'><div class='abstractentry'>Background transfers, or transfers that humans do not actively wait on, dominate the Internet today.

The primary focus of these mechanisms is to increase the likelihood of finding a path with limited information, and so these approaches have only an incidental effect on such routing metrics as maximum or average delivery delay. In this paper, we present RAPID, an intentional DTN routing protocol that can optimize a specific routing metric such as the worst-case delivery delay or the fraction of packets that are delivered within a deadline. The key insight is to treat DTN routing as a resource allocation problem that translates the routing metric into per-packet utilities that determine how packets should be replicated in the system. We evaluate RAPID rigorously through a prototype deployed over a vehicular DTN testbed of 40 buses and simulations based on real traces. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to report on a routing protocol deployed on a real outdoor DTN. Our results suggest that RAPID significantly outperforms existing routing protocols for several metrics. We also show empirically that for small loads, RAPID is within 10% of the optimal performance.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{RAPID-ToN,<br> author = {Aruna Balasubramanian, Brian Levine, Arun Venkataramani},<br> booktitle = {To appear in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (ToN)},<br>  link = {http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/RAPID-ToN.pdf},<br>  title = {Replication routing DTNs: A resource allocation approach},<br> year = {2010}<br>}<br><br></div></div></li><br/><li><a href='http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/diverseTE.pdf'>Beyond MLU: An Application-Centric Comparison of Traffic Engineering Schemes</a><br/> Abhigyan, Aditya Mishra, Vikas Kumar, Arun Venkataramani, <br/>IEEE INFOCOM, April 2011,<br/>A related <a href=http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/diverseTE-poster> poster</a> appeared previously at NSDI'09. <br/><div class='abstract_show_hide'>[+]Show Abstract</div><div class='ab_entry'><div class='abstractentry'>Traffic engineering (TE) has been long studied as a network optimization problem, but its impact on user-perceived application performance has received little attention.

Our application-centric, empirical approach yields two rather unexpected findings. First, link utilization metrics, and MLU in particular, are poor predictors of application performance. Despite significant differences in MLU, all TE schemes and even a static shortest-path routing scheme achieve nearly identical application performance. Second, application adaptation in the form of location diversity, i.e., the ability to download content from multiple potential locations, significantly improves the capacity achieved by all schemes. Even the ability to download from just 2–4 locations enables all TE schemes to achieve near-optimal capacity, and even static routing to be within 30 % of optimal.

Although augmenting BGP with authentication and integrity mechanisms is critical, they are, by design, far from sufficient to prevent attacks based on manipulating the complex BGP protocol itself. In this paper, we identify two serious attacks on two of the most fundamental goals of BGP-to ensure reachability and to enable ASes to pick routes available to them according to their routing policies-even in the presence of BGPSec-like mechanisms. Our key contributions are to (1) formalize a series of critical security properties, (2) experimentally validate using commodity router implementations that BGP fails to achieve those properties, (3) quantify the extent of these vulnerabilities in the Internet's AS topology, and (4) propose simple modifications to provably ensure that those properties are satisfied.

A multi-homed stationary user or a stationary user shifting among multiple devices attached to different networks will persistently keep his/her identity but will change access networks and the IP address to which his/her identity is associated. We perform a measurement study of such user transitioning among networks from a network-level point of view, characterizing the sequence of networks to which a user is attached and discuss insights and implications drawn from these measurements. We characterize network transitioning in terms of network residency time, degree of multi-homing, transition rates and more. We find that users typically spend time attached to a small number of access networks, and that a surprisingly large number of users access two networks contemporaneously.

In this paper, we present RAPID, an intentional DTN routing protocol that can optimize a specific routing metric such as worst-case delivery latency or the fraction of packets that are delivered within a deadline. The key insight is to treat DTN routing as a resource allocation problem that translates the routing metric into per-packet utilities which determine how packets should be replicated in the system. We evaluate RAPID rigorously through a prototype of RAPID deployed over a vehicular DTN testbed of 40 buses and simulations based on real traces. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to report on a routing protocol deployed on a real DTN at this scale. Our results suggest that RAPID significantly outperforms existing routing protocols for several metrics.

However, the ubiquity and low cost of WiFi suggests an attractive alternative, namely, opportunistic use of open WiFi access points (APs) or planned municipal mesh networks. Unfortunately, for vehicular users, the intermittent nature of WiFi connectivity makes it challenging to support popular interactive applications such as Web search and browsing. Our work is driven by two questions. 1) How can we enable system support for interactive web applications to tolerate disruptions in WiFi connectivity from mobile nodes? 2) Can opportunistic mobile-to-mobile (m2m) transfers enhance application performance over only using APs, and if so, under what conditions and by how much? We present Thedu, a system that enables access to Web search from moving vehicles. The key idea is to use aggressive prefetching to transform the interactive Web search application into a one-shot request/response process. We deployed a prototype of Thedu on the DieselNet testbed in Amherst, MA, consisting of transit buses averaging 21 on the road at a time. Our deployment results show that Thedu can deliver 4 times as many relevant web pages than not using Thedu. A bus receives relevant web pages with a mean delay of 2.3 minutes and within 0.55 minutes in areas with high AP density. Thedu augments AP connectivity with m2m transfers using a utility-driven DTN routing algorithm and uses caching to exploit query locality. Our analytic model and trace-driven simulations suggest that m2m routing yields little benefit over using APs alone even under moderately dense AP deployment such as in Amherst. With sparsely deployed APs as may be the case in rural areas, our conclusions are more mixed: m2m routing with caching improves the number of relevant responses delivered per bus by up to 58%, but the mean delay is significantly high at 6.7 minutes, calling into question its practicality for interactive applications.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{thedu-mobicom,<br> author = {Aruna Balasubramanian and Brian N.

Using this model, we develop TailEnder, a protocol that reduces energy consumption of common mobile applications. For applications that can tolerate a small delay such as e-mail, TailEnder schedules transfers so as to minimize the cumulative energy consumed meeting user-specified deadlines. We show that the TailEnder scheduling algorithm is within a factor 2x of the optimal and show that any online algorithm can at best be within a factor 1.62x of the optimal.

We demonstrate proof-of-concept that auspice can serve as a complete end-to-end mobility solution as well as enable novel context-based communication primitives that generalize name- or address-based communication in today's Internet.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/SharmaTUVWY14,<br> author = {Abhigyan Sharma and Xiaozheng Tie and Hardeep Uppal and Arun Venkataramani and David Westbrook and Aditya Yadav},<br> bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, http://dblp.org},<br> biburl = {http://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/bib/conf/sigcomm/SharmaTUVWY14},<br> booktitle = {{ACM} {SIGCOMM} 2014 Conference, SIGCOMM'14, Chicago, IL, USA, August<br>17-22, 2014},<br>  crossref = {DBLP:conf/sigcomm/2014},<br> doi = {10.1145/2619239.2626331},<br> link = {http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2619239.2626331},<br> pages = {247--258},<br> timestamp = {Wed, 13 Aug 2014 13:02:23 +0200},<br> title = {A global name service for a highly mobile internetwork},<br> year = {2014}<br>}<br><br></div></div></li><br/><li><a href='http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2619239.2626333'>Towards a quantitative comparison of location-independent network architectures</a><br/> Zhaoyu Gao and Arun Venkataramani and James F.

17-22, 2014 <br/><div class='abstract_show_hide'>[+]Show Abstract</div><div class='ab_entry'><div class='abstractentry'>This paper presents a quantitative methodology and results comparing different approaches for location-independent communication. Our approach is empirical and is based on real Internet topologies, routing tables from real routers, and a measured workload of the mobility of devices and content across network addresses today. We measure the extent of network mobility exhibited by mobile devices with a home-brewn Android app deployed on hundreds of smartphones, and measure the network mobility of Internet content from distributed vantage points. We combine this measured data with our quantitative methodology to analyze the different cost-benefit tradeoffs struck by location-independent network architectures with respect to routing update cost, path stretch, and forwarding table size. We find that more than 20% of users change over 10 IP addresses a day, suggesting that mobility is the norm rather than the exception, so intrinsic and efficient network support for mobility is critical. We also find that with purely name-based routing approaches, each event involving the mobility of a device or popular content may result in an update at up to 14% of Internet routers; but, the fraction of impacted routers is much smaller for the long tail of unpopular content. These results suggest that recent proposals for pure name-based networking are suitable for highly aggregateable content that does not move frequently but may need to be augmented with addressing-assisted approaches to handle device mobility.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/GaoVKH14,<br> author = {Zhaoyu Gao and Arun Venkataramani and James F.

17-21, 2013 <br/><div class='abstract_show_hide'>[+]Show Abstract</div><div class='ab_entry'><div class='abstractentry'>Several major Internet service providers today also offer content distribution services. The emergence of such "network-CDNs" (NCDNs) is driven both by market forces as well as the cost of carrying ever-increasing volumes of traffic across their backbones. An NCDN has the flexibility to determine both where content is placed and how traffic is routed within the network. However NCDNs today continue to treat traffic engineering independently from content placement and request redirection decisions. In this paper, we investigate the interplay between content distribution strategies and traffic engineering and ask whether or how an NCDN should address these concerns in a joint manner. Our experimental analysis, based on traces from a large content distribution network and real ISP topologies, shows that realistic (i.e., history-based) joint optimization strategies offer little benefit (and often significantly underperform) compared to simple and "unplanned" strategies for routing and placement such as InverseCap and LRU. We also find that the simpler strategies suffice to achieve network cost and user-perceived latencies close to those of a joint-optimal strategy with future knowledge.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{DBLP:conf/sigmetrics/SharmaVS13,<br> author = {Abhigyan Sharma and Arun Venkataramani and Ramesh K.
