Most prior efforts have focused on attacks that can be addressed using traditional cryptographic techniques to ensure authentication or integrity, e.g., BGPSec and related works. Although augmenting BGP with authentication and integrity mechanisms is critical, they are, by design, far from sufficient to prevent attacks based on manipulating the complex BGP protocol itself. In this paper, we identify two serious attacks on two of the most fundamental goals of BGP-to ensure reachability and to enable ASes to pick routes available to them according to their routing policies-even in the presence of BGPSec-like mechanisms. Our key contributions are to (1) formalize a series of critical security properties, (2) experimentally validate using commodity router implementations that BGP fails to achieve those properties, (3) quantify the extent of these vulnerabilities in the Internet's AS topology, and (4) propose simple modifications to provably ensure that those properties are satisfied. Our experiments show that, using our attacks, a single malicious AS can cause thousands of other ASes to become disconnected from thousands of other ASes for arbitrarily long, while our suggested modifications almost completely eliminate such attacks.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@article{DBLP:journals/ton/SongVG16,<br> author = {Yang Song and Arun Venkataramani and Lixin Gao},<br> bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, http://dblp.org},<br> biburl = {http://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/bib/journals/ton/SongVG16},<br>  doi = {10.1109/TNET.2015.2503642},<br> journal = {{IEEE/ACM} Trans.

Physical mobility, however, differs from user identity (name) mobility in both traditional mobility management protocols such as Mobile-IP and in new architectures, such as XIA and MobilityFirst, that support identity mobility and location independence as first class objects. A multi-homed stationary user or a stationary user shifting among multiple devices attached to different networks will persistently keep his/her identity but will change access networks and the IP address to which his/her identity is associated. We perform a measurement study of such user transitioning among networks from a network-level point of view, characterizing the sequence of networks to which a user is attached and discuss insights and implications drawn from these measurements. We characterize network transitioning in terms of network residency time, degree of multi-homing, transition rates and more. We find that users typically spend time attached to a small number of access networks, and that a surprisingly large number of users access two networks contemporaneously. We develop and validate a parsimonious Markov chain model of canonical user transitioning among networks that can be used to provision network services and to analyze mobility protocols.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{DBLP:conf/infocom/YangKHV15,<br> author = {Sookhyun Yang and Jim Kurose and Simon Heimlicher and Arun Venkataramani},<br> bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, http://dblp.org},<br> biburl = {http://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/bib/conf/infocom/YangKHV15},<br> booktitle = {2015 {IEEE} Conference on Computer Communications, {INFOCOM}<br>2015, Kowloon, Hong Kong, April 26 - May 1, 2015},<br>  crossref = {DBLP:conf/infocom/2015},<br> doi = {10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218453},<br> link = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218453},<br> pages = {828--836},<br> timestamp = {Tue, 01 Sep 2015 14:37:13 +0200},<br> title = {Measurement and modeling of user transitioning among networks},<br> year = {2015}<br>}<br><br></div></div></li><br/><li><a href='http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2012.2212205'>Content Availability and Bundling in Swarming Systems</a><br/> Daniel S.

Our work is motivated by the observation that recent research results suggest significant overhead amortization benefits of blocks. Yet state-of-the-art bitrate algorithms are optimized for adaptation on a per-packet basis, so they can either have the amortization benefits of blocks or high responsiveness to underlying channel conditions of packets, but not both. To bridge this disparity, BlockRate employs multiple bitrates within a block that are predictive of future channel conditions. In each feedback round, BlockRate uses a historybased scheme to predict the SNR for packets within the next block. In slow-changing scenarios as under pedestrian mobility, BlockRate uses a simple linear regression model to predict the SNR trend over the next block. In fast-changing scenarios as under vehicular mobility, BlockRate uses a path loss model to capture more significant SNR variations within a block. We have implemented a prototype of BlockRate in a commodity 802.11 driver and evaluated it via deployment on an indoor mesh testbed as well as an outdoor vehicular testbed. Our evaluation shows that BlockRate achieves up to 1.4× and 2.8× improvement in goodput under indoor and outdoor mobility respectively.</div></div><div class='bib_tex_show_hide'>[+]Show Bib</div><div class='bibentry'><div class='bibtexentry'>@inproceedings{blockrate,<br> author = {Xiaozheng Tie, Anand Seetharam, Arun Venkataramani, Deepak Ganesan, Dennis Goeckel},<br> booktitle = {ACM SIGCOMM Conference on Emerging Networking Experiments and Technologies (CoNEXT)},<br>  month = {December},<br>  title = {Anticipatory Wireless Bitrate Control for Blocks},<br> year = {2011}<br>}<br><br></div></div></li><br/><li><a href='http://www.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/ZZ.pdf'>ZZ and the Art of Practical BFT Execution</a><br/> Tim Wood, Rahul Singh, Arun Venkataramani, Emmanuel Cecchet, Prashant Shenoy, <br/>ACM SIGOPS EuroSys, April 2011 <br/><div class='abstract_show_hide'>[+]Show Abstract</div><div class='ab_entry'><div class='abstractentry'>The high replication cost of Byzantine fault-tolerance (BFT) methods has been a major barrier to their widespread adoption in commercial distributed applications.
