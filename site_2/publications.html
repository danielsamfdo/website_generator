With tens of CDNs competing for content producers, it is important to understand the game played by these CDNs and whether the game is sustainable in the long term. In this paper, we formulate a gametheoretic model to analyze price competition among CDNs. Under this model, we propose an optimal strategy employed by two-CDN games.
